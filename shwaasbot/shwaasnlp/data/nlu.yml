    - [Vinay](name)[Vinay](name)[Vinay](name) reports that he had not been able to record the first time he tried. However this recording at second attempt seems to have worked
    - Nahi to bahut zyada notification generate karega
    - I'm not sure listening mode is very useful here ' we can also change option 2 to the app selection option
    - Also need to decide what message should play if user chooses to listen
    - But option 2 was difficult to select
    - Recording was okay
    - i am talking to another coder tonight to see if we can go faster on logging and feature adds
    - ok, i think setting change may have helped...but let me log the calls in any case so that we have scientific observations :)
    - Okay, one more bug - if the script uploads the file during the recording, it just gets a blank file
    - Before launch
    - So these are few things to test
    - We have not put anything there...we should have a list
    - Before sharing with community
    - *few
    - I think with colleagues is fine as long as they will be able to give us feedback...we can also collect from backend
    - I would be keen  to test bit more first
    - I.e. how many out of 10 attempts succeed
    - And see what's the failure rate
    - So we should do few more tests
    - Ok, I have not changed anything
    - so that we are at least aware
    - i will also start logging the calls where recording did not come, for the time being
    - i am seeing some errors on the list
    - @Vinnuji99 looks like there are still issues with the recording from ganiyari
    - mere recordings mein bhi i had to press 1 twice
- intent: request
  examples: |
    - [8171211838](mobile_num)[8171211838](mobile_num)[8171211838](mobile_num) please record some test calls on this number and confirm that they are
    - @[vinay](name) can you figure out what the issue is?
    - But would be good to get fee user feedback
    - please file an issue
- intent: rn_request
  examples: |
    - jab bhi kisi ko bhi group me se samay mile, ek test call record kar dein - mai logs ka analysis ke liye bhi ek system laga deta hun jisse hamein ye pata chalta rahe ki kitni call fail hui aur kitni success
    - ab try kar ke dekhein
    - uska bhi issue file karna hai
- intent: rn_info
  examples: |
    - ok, i will make some fixes and update - fir ek round testing aur karna hoga
    - Ye maine re-send kiya hai
    - settibg change kiya hai
    - ek aur problem tum document be bataye the
    - aaj raat ko try karte hain
- intent: question
  examples: |
    - Vinay, what's your availability to test?
