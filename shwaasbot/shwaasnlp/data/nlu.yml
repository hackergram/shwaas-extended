      [Vinay](name)[Vinay](name)[Vinay](name) reports that he had not been able to record the first time he tried. However this recording at second attempt seems to have worked
  - text: |
      Nahi to bahut zyada notification generate karega
  - text: |
      I'm not sure listening mode is very useful here ' we can also change option 2 to the app selection option
  - text: |
      Also need to decide what message should play if user chooses to listen
  - text: |
      But option 2 was difficult to select
  - text: |
      Recording was okay
  - text: |
      i am talking to another coder tonight to see if we can go faster on logging and feature adds
  - text: |
      ok, i think setting change may have helped...but let me log the calls in any case so that we have scientific observations :)
  - text: |
      Okay, one more bug - if the script uploads the file during the recording, it just gets a blank file
  - text: |
      Before launch
  - text: |
      So these are few things to test
  - text: |
      We have not put anything there...we should have a list
  - text: |
      Before sharing with community
  - text: |
      *few
  - text: |
      I think with colleagues is fine as long as they will be able to give us feedback...we can also collect from backend
  - text: |
      I would be keen  to test bit more first
  - text: |
      I.e. how many out of 10 attempts succeed
  - text: |
      And see what's the failure rate
  - text: |
      So we should do few more tests
  - text: |
      Ok, I have not changed anything
  - text: |
      so that we are at least aware
  - text: |
      i will also start logging the calls where recording did not come, for the time being
  - text: |
      i am seeing some errors on the list
  - text: |
      @Vinnuji99 looks like there are still issues with the recording from ganiyari
  - text: |
      mere recordings mein bhi i had to press 1 twice

      I think Matrix mein DTMF setting ke saath thoda experiment karna padega

      bilkul - aap ise apni aawaaz mein record kar ke whatsapp par bhi bhej sakte hain aur isi number par bhi record kar sakte hain
