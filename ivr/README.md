# Shwaas IVR

### Install MojoBol and Dependencies

Instructions on installing mojobol can be found in https://gitlab.com/mojolab/mojobol/-/blob/master/README.md


### Install the Shwaas call flow
Call flows are stored under shwaasivr/callflows

These are call flows exported from Verboice - for a full description see - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK-tm1eF8Lc


For quick setup, just create a directory under ``` /opt ``` and copy the callflow dolder there. 
Some tweaks may have to be made to make it all work to the .conf file. 

TODO - call flow installation tool.
